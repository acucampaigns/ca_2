                <blockquote>
                    <p>We have been approached by countless individuals, who informed us that they knew that they were qualified to immigrate to Canada and had all of the necessary documents and then went ahead to apply for Permanent Residence in Canada on their own and failed. It is true that there is not much that our firm can do insofar as some of your documents are concerned (i.e. a birth certificate is a birth certificate, a marriage certificate is a marriage certificate, etc.); however, we caution you, now, that if your letters of reference are in the least bit deficient or your Application forms have not been completed, correctly, you will surely jeopardize the expeditious processing of your Application for Permanent Residence. Among the services that we provide are ensuring that your letters of reference comply with Citizenship and Immigration Canada's standards; ensuring that your Application forms have been filled out correctly (incidentally, we rarely have seen the forms filled out correctly); and drafting written, legal arguments, which will accompany your Application package and which will argue why you should be issued Canadian Permanent Residence. The analogy we provide where our arguments are concerned is that of a painter. Paint, in and of itself, is beautiful. However, paint has no meaning unless it is used by a painter to paint a beautiful picture. In the Immigration context, your qualifications may be impressive; however, if you do not have effective representation whereby a lawyer will highlight your qualifications for Citizenship and Immigration Canada officials to appreciate, your qualifications can get lost/overlooked in your mountain of supporting documents.</p>

Our firm enjoys a near 100% success rate with clients, who retain us, via the Internet because we do not accept cases that are borderline and that have no hope of succeeding. Suffice it to say, if we positively assessed your qualifications for Immigration to Canada, we believe that you stand a very good chance of applying for and receiving Canadian Permanent Residence with our assistance. We do not believe in wasting people's time and money and our reputation is far too important for us to risk making "quick" profits at our clients' expense.

                    <p>If you had completed our Online Eligibility Assessment Questionnaire and were favourably assessed, we would have provided you with links to our Agreement and Payment Instructions with your assessment.</p>
                    <p>If you would like to retain/engage our services, you need only print your name and insert your signature on the Agreement, where indicated, and return the document to our office with your initial payment of our legal fees.</p>
                    <p>The easiest way to remit payment is by credit card or VISA debit card online on our secure Online Payment Facility at <a href="payment/default.htm">https://www.akcanada.com/payment/</a></p>
                    <p>It has been our experience that sometimes, for your protection, credit/debit card companies refuse to authorize online payments if the amount exceeds a certain pre-set limit or if a payment is being remitted over the Internet, especially to an overseas company (for fear of a stolen credit/debit card and/or credit/debit card fraud).</p>
                    <p>Your best course of action might be to telephone your card issuer and advise them that you will be making an online payment to Canada.  More than likely, they will pre-authorize the transaction and then you can remit payment online at <a href="payment/default.htm">https://www.akcanada.com/payment/</a></p>

                    <p>If remitting the first installment of our legal fees, via wire transfer or credit card, the signed Agreement can be faxed or scanned and e-mailed to our office.</p>
                    <p>If remitting the first installment of our legal fees, via money order/bank draft/cashier's cheque/traveller's cheque, the signed Agreement can be sent to our office, via mail or courier, in the same envelope as that in which you enclose your payment.  <strong>We recommend you use a courier service such as FedEx/UPS/DHL since international mail to Canada can take several weeks to arrive.</strong></p>
                    <p>Just as soon as your initial payment has been received by our office, we shall prepare our preliminary package to send to you, via e-mail, which contains all of the necessary forms, document checklists, instructions and information so as to enable you to commence the Immigration Application process with our assistance.</p>

                <a name="31"></a>

                <p><strong>1. Where do I apply for Permanent Residence in Canada?</strong></p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>Most Applications for Permanent Residence in Canada are filed, initially, with a Case Processing Centre or Centralized Intake Office in Canada and then they are ultimately processed to completion by a Canadian visa office, which has geographic responsibility for the country in which the applicant has been lawfully admitted and has resided for a period of at least one (1) year. Otherwise, it is the Canadian visa office, which has geographic responsibility for the applicant’s country of citizenship that will process the Application to completion.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>Processing times will depend on:</p>

                    <p>Nobody can promise you a specific processing timeframe and any lawyer/consultant that guarantees processing times is being less than truthful with you. Lawyers/consultants can give estimates; however, they CANNOT guarantee processing times as processing times are ALWAYS subject to change WITHOUT advance notice.</p>
                    <p>Do not choose a law firm on the basis of how quickly they promise your case will be processed. Rather, choose a law firm that you feel will be competent to prepare your case correctly and expeditiously and be attentive to your needs</p>

                    <p>The majority of cases, these days, are approved without the need for a personal interview, although an applicant can be convoked to interview if there is a security issue and/or there is an issue concerning the applicant’s claims and/or supporting documentation.  Citizenship and Immigration Canada officials also randomly select very qualified applicants for "Quality Assurance Interviews" whereby the Department has an opportunity to satisfy itself that it is making the right decisions as to which cases merit waivers of interview</p>

Citizenship and Immigration Canada only accepts the IELTS general test results and NOT the academic test results and results are only valid for two (2) years.  IELTS test results must be included when we file your Application.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, if claiming French language ability, all principal applicants (even those born and living in a French-speaking country) must now undergo the TEF (<a href="../www.fda.ccip.fr/default.htm">http://www.fda.ccip.fr/</a>).

                <blockquote>
                    <p>The Government of Canada has vacillated back and forth on this issue. It used to be that all applicants age eighteen (18) and over had to attend the interview with the understanding that if a spouse or adult child could not, for whatever reason, attend the interview, the requirement of his/her attendance would be waived. Then the Government changed its policy and stated that adult dependants did NOT have to attend the interview. Now, the pendulum has swung back to the original position and adult dependants must attend the interview. Ultimately, it is subject to the discretion of the visa officer, having carriage of the file, as to whether to waive the requirement that an adult dependant be interviewed if he/she does not present himself/herself at the interview.</p>

                    <p>Only spouses/partners and dependent children can be included on an Application for Permanent Residence in Canada as accompanying dependants. Parents cannot. You may, however, be eligible to sponsor your parents to immigrate to Canada as Members of the Family Class once you are residing here as a permanent resident of this country and meet Minimum Necessary Income requirements as established by Citizenship and Immigration Canada officials.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately not. In order for children to accompany a parent to Canada as dependants, the children must be under age nineteen (19) or over age nineteen (19) and mentally or physically disabled and dependent on his/her parent(s).</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>Your temporary entry to Canada is subject to the discretion of the Immigration officer at the Canadian port of entry and they may refuse you entry if they know that you have applied for Permanent Residence in Canada and are, thus, an intending immigrant and not merely a visitor. If questioned whether you have an Application for Permanent Residence in progress, you must answer this question, truthfully; however, you should emphasize that your visit to Canada is merely temporary in nature and that it is your full intention to leave Canada upon the completion of your visit. Generally speaking, most of our clients in your situation have never experienced any difficulties, attempting to enter Canada as visitors while their Applications for Permanent Residence were in process although entry is NEVER guaranteed.</p>
