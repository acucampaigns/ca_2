not connected with any government department, agency or bureau. During your online application
process you may see notes regarding further information about the travel authorization you are applying
for. When you click on the associated button you are understood to be entering into an agreement with
our company.</p>
<p>All visitors to our website have the option of lodging their own applications directly on the official
government portal without our assistance. The application cost for a Canada travel authorization is
currently CAN $ 7.00 charged directly by the Canadian government. We will though not be able to assist
with applications that we have not reviewed and processed.</p>

    line-height: 0px;
    padding-top: 21px;
">3) Payment for our Products and Services</h4><br />
<p>There is no charge to access our website, view our products/services or ask questions. However, we do
charge for verifying, processing and/or reviewing applications. Before you start an eTA application we
will clearly tell you what the cost of our service will be. All individual eTA applications processed are
charged at USD $ 93.00 each, which includes tax and the Canada government mandatory fee of CAN $
7.00. There are no other fees charged. By completing the steps and clicking on the pay button, you are
agreeing to the fee charged by our company.</p>
<p>Payment can only be made by credit card; all major brands are accepted. The cost of the service or
product will be charged in U.S. dollars ($).</p>
<p>If you use a credit card in a currency other than U.S. dollars, your credit card provider will convert the
price in U.S. dollar into your local currency using their own exchange rate. The charge will show on your
statement after 4-8 days. The transaction may also incur additional fees or card-use charges levied by
your credit card provider. We have no influence over such additional fees.</p>
<h4 style="
    color: rgba(1, 60, 115, 0.49);
    line-height: 0px;
    padding-top: 21px;
">4) eTA Application Processing</h4><br />
<p>It is your sole responsibility to find out whether a visa is required for you to visit another country before
you travel. Depending upon your nationality and personal history, you may be eligible to apply for an eTA
(Electronic Travel Authorization) when traveling to Canada. To obtain an eTA you must provide certain
details about yourself, your passport and your reason for visiting the country.</p>
<p>Our website services provide online application forms with all the questions you will need to answer in
order to submit an application for eTA. Part of our specialized service is to review the answers you
provide, along with your information, before we process and submit the application on your behalf. If we
We offer to process and review electronic travel authorization applications for travel to Canada. Please

need any additional information or see anything that may jeopardize your application, we will contact
you by email. Please note that any verification of information will delay the processing period.</p>
<p>Once we have ascertained that the information you have provided is valid and complete, we submit your
application to the Canadian government department for approval. If for any reason your application
cannot be submitted for processing, we will inform you and refund your payment in full.</p>
<p>To receive a response to your eTA application can take up to 72 hours. However, we advise all travelers
to begin the eTA application process as soon as possible, and at least 7 days before your departure in
order to allow time for any unforeseen delays or problems.</p>
<h4 style="
    color: rgba(1, 60, 115, 0.49);
    line-height: 0px;
    padding-top: 21px;
">5) What Happens if your E-visa or eTA Application is Denied</h4><br />
<p>If for any reason we are unable to process your application, you can submit another application using a
different service provider. Alternatively, you can go directly to the relevant government website and
submit an application yourself. The final decision to approve or reject any eTA or E-visa application lies
entirely with each government. If your application is denied, we recommend that you get in touch with
the embassy or consulate representing the country you wish to visit and they will advise you of the best
way to apply for a standard visa instead. This can take longer than a regular E-visa, so time should be
allowed for this possible delay.</p><br />
<p>In exceptional circumstances, a government may choose to withdraw approval for an Electronic Travel
Authorization (E-visa or eTA) even after it has been approved. In certain situations, they are authorized
to change the status from 'Approved' to 'Not authorized to visit with an E-visa'. Even if your application is
approved, it is only an authorization to travel. It does not guarantee entry into the country you are
intending to visit. The final decision lies with the Customs and Immigration Officer when you arrive at
the port of entry. We cannot take any responsibility for any losses incurred if a decision is made to
decline or withdraw approval for you to enter a country. We cannot be held liable for any costs or claims
resulting from such a decision.</p>

">6) Your Responsibilities</h4><br />
<p>It is the sole responsibility of any traveller to comply with all requirements regarding their visit to a

foreign country. You are required to answer all questions honestly and fully when making your eTA or E-
visa application. If any information is incorrect, you may not be allowed to board a flight or boat, or you

may be refused entry to your intended destination country. In this instance our company cannot be held
liable for any subsequent costs or inconveniences.</p>

complete application and payment are submitted. The order is accepted by us once we dispatch the
